# AI-project-3
This repo will be used for project 3 of the AI Bootcamp.
### Issue
Livestock and domestic animals are falling victim to attacks by predators like coyotes, foxes, and other predatory species.

### Objective
To develop an alert system that employs computer vision technology to detect predators such as coyotes and foxes, and promptly notify the owners. This system aims to protect livestock and pets from potential threats.
