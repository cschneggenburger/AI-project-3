### Issue
Livestock and domestic animals are falling victim to attacks by predators like coyotes, foxes, and other predatory species.

### Objective
To develop an alert system that employs computer vision technology to detect predators such as coyotes and foxes, and promptly notify the owners. This system aims to protect livestock and pets from potential threats.


## Background: Livestock Predation 

- Predation accounts for the majority of livestock losses in agriculture.
- According to the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) in 2006:
  - Predators accounted for a loss of **190,000 head of cattle**.
  - This amounted to a monetary loss of **92.7 million dollars**.
- In California:
  - In 2015, just **1%** of reported death losses of mature cattle were attributed to predators.
  - In 2014, **19%** of reported death losses in mature sheep were caused by predators.
  - Approximately **6%** of reported calf losses in 2015 were due to predators.
  - Over **45%** of lamb losses were predator-caused.
- Only **220,000 cattle losses** stemmed from livestock predators or **0.23%** of the total cattle production over the year.

Predators include animals such as coyotes, wolves, foxes, mountain lions, grizzlies, and eagles. They play vital roles in our ecosystems but can pose challenges for ranching operations. Various strategies are used to manage livestock predation, including modifications of animal husbandry practices and habitat, population management, and novel approaches developed through research.
